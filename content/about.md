As a PhD student specializing in Responsible AI at the University of Porto, I focus on the task of stress testing machine learning models in regions of uncertainty, aiming to enhance their reliability and robustness. Currently based in Porto, Portugal, my research is supported by the [AISym4Med](https://aisym4med.eu/) project, which is dedicated to advancing AI technologies in healthcare. In addition to my research, I serve as a teaching assistant and supervise several masterâ€™s students.
